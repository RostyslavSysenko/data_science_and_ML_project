## About Project 
Wealth creation is a process that can requires different characteristics and habits depedning on the environemnt the person is in. Applying general advice is not always a good idea, especially when it comes to wealth creation. This project aims to solve this problem for all NSW residents and create a uniquely tailored advice on how to become wealthy within the state of NSW based on characteristics of wealthy NSW residents. This advice will include habits/patterns that an individual should adopt to become financially sucesfull in a state of NSW to help NSW residents avoid frustration and wastage of time on pursuit of their ambitious financial goal. Can we find relationships and correlations of particular attributes of residents of Australia and overall determine what someones average wealth would be based on their postcode? In this project, we analyze all NSW postcodes and rank postcodes as according to the wealth levels of their average resident. Then all of the postcodes are analysed according to various metrics to deterimene the characteristics of that postcode. The created model will allow NSW residents to see whether they are residing in areas that are promoting growth in wealth, and why they residents of that postcode are experiencing such financial growth. When we discover what attributes are directly related to residents wealth levels within these postcodes, it may be possible to examine an area, and suggest what can be done to increase the level of wealth within that community based off of these findings. This model is designed so that NSW residents can obtain quick evaluation of where they are at and what they can improve to get to where they want to be financially.
